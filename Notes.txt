React

- React Router mounts different webpages upon new route. If route is the same but with different parameters, it will
only change props. Not mount again.




Elastic Search
- at least 8 GB RAM
- prefer to use more cores rather than increase clock speed but both are good

Elastic Search optimizations:
- Bulk operations
- Reduce refresh rate
- 0 replica's and reduce shards if possible. Less shards generally means faster if you have the same number of nodes.


Cassandra
- Increase RAM and cores

MongoDB
- Single threaded


- Measure resource usage by node/express app

/etc/sysctl.conf to control network connections and files per process in kernel

net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
# This one is not necessarily needed --> fs.file-max = 100000

ulimit num files can be modified in /etc/security/limits.conf with:
* - nofile 16384
